# DayTripper :world_map: - BITEHack 2019

The project made during BiteHack 2019 - annual hackathon organized by BEST AGH Krak√≥w.
The topic of this edition was Open Data.

While looking for ideas we came to conclusion that there's no program or app which could made plans of themed, day-long trips around city.

For example: you wake up in the morning in new city, but you don't have exact plans for today. So you open our website, choose whether you want to see only churches or only museums that day in a city, and we will show you easy plan and map of a nearby attractions within timeframe you gave us.

Easy? Of course!
No more boredom during your trips!
